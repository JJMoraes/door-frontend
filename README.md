<h1 align="center">Welcome to Front-End from Door Project :door:</h1>

> The ideia of this project is build a access control system. The system will put up on the door of Fábrica de Software at Instituto Federal Catarinense - Araquari. With this, only students that work on researchs and authorized by the coordinator will have access to the place.

> To build this project we use Nest.js on the back-end, Flutter on front-end and a Arduino Mega 2560 with a w5100 Ethernet shield and a RC522 RFID shield.
